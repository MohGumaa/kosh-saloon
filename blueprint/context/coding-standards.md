# Coding Standards

> Tuned by `/onboard` for Kosh CRM: Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 +
> TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind CSS v4, managed with pnpm. Prisma 7 (PostgreSQL
> via `@prisma/adapter-pg`), shadcn/ui (Base UI, RTL enabled), next-intl, and
> next-themes are installed. Zod and Recharts are added by the feature that
> first needs them.

## TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use proper typing or `unknown`
- Define interfaces for all props, API responses, and data models
- Use type inference where obvious, explicit types where helpful

## React

- Functional components only (no class components)
- Use hooks for state and side effects
- Keep components focused - one job per component
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## Next.js

- Server components by default
- Only use `'use client'` when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use Server Actions for form submissions and simple mutations
- Use API routes when you need:
  - Webhooks (Clerk, GitHub, etc.)
  - File uploads with progress tracking
  - Long-running operations
  - Specific HTTP status codes or headers
  - Endpoints for future mobile/CLI clients
  - Third-party integrations
- Otherwise, fetch data directly in server components
- Dynamic routes for item/collection pages

## File Organization

No `src/` directory: the App Router lives at the root `app/`, and the import
alias `@/*` maps to the project root.

- Pages: `app/[route]/page.tsx`
- Components: `components/[feature]/ComponentName.tsx`
- Server Actions: `actions/[feature].ts`
- Types: `types/[feature].ts`
- Lib/Utils: `lib/[utility].ts`

- Layout components: `components/layout/`; shadcn/ui primitives: `components/ui/`
- Signed-in app pages live in the `app/(app)/` route group, which renders the shell
- Translations: `locales/en.json`, `locales/ar.json`; i18n config: `i18n/`
- Prisma schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`; client: `lib/db.ts` (import `db`)

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`ItemCard.tsx`)
- Files: Match component name or kebab-case
- Functions: camelCase
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (no prefix)

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Tailwind v4: CSS-first config (`@theme` in `globals.css`), no `tailwind.config.js`
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
- No inline styles
- Support light, dark, and system themes
- Use logical properties and utilities (`ms-*`, `me-*`, `ps-*`, `start-*`,
  `text-start`) instead of left/right so layouts work in RTL

## Internationalization

- All user-facing text is available in English and Arabic; no hardcoded UI strings
- Arabic renders right-to-left (`dir="rtl"`)
- Bilingual data (for example service names) stores both languages

- Library: `next-intl` without i18n routing. Routes have no locale prefix; the
  locale comes from the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie (`en` | `ar`, default `en`)
- Server components use `getTranslations`; client components use `useTranslations`
- Add every key to both `locales/en.json` and `locales/ar.json` (same key set)
- The root layout sets `<html lang dir>`; Base UI components get the direction
  from `DirectionProvider`

## Database

PostgreSQL (cloud-hosted) via Prisma 7 with the `pg` driver adapter.

- Use Prisma ORM for all database operations
- Always use `prisma migrate dev` for schema changes (not `db push`)
- Run `prisma migrate status` before committing to verify migrations are in sync
- Production deployments must run `prisma migrate deploy` before the app starts

## Data Fetching

- Server components fetch directly with Prisma
- Client components use Server Actions
- Validate all inputs with Zod
- Authorize every Server Action and Route Handler on the server by the
  session user's role and permissions; never trust a client-supplied user id,
  role, or amount
- STAFF queries are scoped to the session user's own records

> TODO: the authentication library is not chosen yet.

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch in Server Actions
- Return `{ success, data, error }` pattern from actions
- Display user-friendly error messages via toast

## Testing

The blueprint installs no test runner; testing is opt-in at the project level,
because the overlay can't know your stack. Adding unit testing is an explicit
setup task the AI can do through the normal workflow, either as a build-plan item
or with `/tests`. The setup should choose the stack-native runner, wire the
scripts or commands, add a small example test, and update the Commands section
of `AGENTS.md`.

When `AGENTS.md` declares a `Verify` command, treat it as the umbrella automated
gate. It combines only the checks this project actually has, in this order when
available: typecheck, tests, then build. The command does not enable an absent
test runner or replace focused evidence. It gives local work and optional CI one
exact command to run. `/ci` owns Verify and CI setup. `/tests` adds the real test
command to Verify when it already exists, but never creates CI only because
testing was configured.

**The opt-in switch is one signal: a `test` command in the Commands section of
`AGENTS.md`.** Declare one and **tests become a gate for logic-bearing steps**,
not an optional extra; leave it out and the loop verifies logic with the evidence
it already uses (run it, a screenshot, the build). Adding the runner is itself a
deliberate step, never a silent mid-step install. This is the single definition
of the switch; the skills and `ai-interaction.md` only point back here.

- **What to test (the scope rule):** pure logic where a wrong answer is possible -
  parsers, formatters, validators, id/slug builders, server actions. These have
  assertable inputs and outputs and real edge cases (empty, missing, malformed).
- **What not to test:** UI components and integration-level surfaces (render or
  export routes, anything driving a real browser or external service). Verify those
  with a screenshot and the build, not brittle unit tests.
- **The gate (when a runner is configured):** a build step that adds in-scope logic
  must ship a passing test in the same reviewable diff. The project's test command
  must be green before the step is approved, before any checkpoint commit, and
  before `/complete` merges. UI and integration-only steps are exempt and ride on
  screenshot plus build evidence.
- **When it's named:** the `/feature` spec's Testing section predicts the coverage,
  `/implement` writes the test with the step, and if a step surfaces logic the spec
  didn't foresee, add a focused test then.
- An empty suite should fail, not pass, so "no tests ran" never looks like "passed".
- Test files live next to source files (for example `feature.test.ts`).
- Run them via the project's test command (see Commands in `AGENTS.md`), not a
  hardcoded tool name.

Current status: no test runner is configured, so there is no test gate yet.
When `/tests` adds one, the expected binding is Vitest, `vi.mock()` for external
dependencies (Prisma, auth), and `vi.useFakeTimers()` for time-dependent logic.
Financial calculations (shares, earnings, settlements, report totals) are prime
in-scope logic.

## Browser Verification

For UI and integration behavior, prefer real browser evidence over reading the
code and assuming it works.

- Browser automation is separately opt-in through `/tests browser`. That setup
  reuses a compatible runner or prefers Playwright for supported projects, then
  documents the exact command as `Browser tests` in `AGENTS.md`.
- When `Browser tests` is declared, add focused coverage for stable behavioral
  done-whens when it is proportionate, and run the documented command during
  `/check`. Do not assume it proves visual fidelity, real authenticated-profile
  behavior, browser chrome, or another claim the test does not observe.
- If no Browser tests command is declared, do not add a runner silently in the
  middle of an unrelated feature. Use the available dev server, browser
  screenshots, build output, API output, or manual evidence instead.
- Browser tests are not part of the default Verify command or CI unless the user
  separately chooses that slower gate.
- Browser evidence is especially important for flows that click, type, submit,
  navigate, download files, render complex layouts, or depend on client-side
  state.

## Code Quality

- No commented-out code unless specified
- No unused imports or variables
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible

## Comments

Write code that explains itself; comment only what the code cannot say.
Over-commenting is a common AI tell, so resist it.

- Comment the **why**, not the **what**. Delete any comment that restates the code.
- No banner/header blocks, section dividers, or step-by-step narration of obvious
  code. A file does not need a comment announcing each region.
- A comment earns its place only when it captures something the code can't: a
  non-obvious decision, a gotcha or workaround, why a value is what it is, or a
  link to a spec or issue.
- Prefer self-documenting names and small functions over explanatory comments.
- Keep doc comments minimal: a one-line purpose on an exported type or function is
  plenty; don't write JSDoc that just repeats the signature.
- When in doubt, leave the comment out.

## Writing

- No em dashes (U+2014) in generated content: docs, comments, commit messages,
  READMEs, specs. They read as AI-generated.
- Use a hyphen for `term - description` separators; rephrase prose with commas,
  parentheses, or a colon. Avoid en dashes and the ellipsis character too.
